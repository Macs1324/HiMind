# HiMind - Comprehensive Product Specification

## Executive Summary

HiMind is an intelligent expertise routing system that automatically discovers who knows what within an organization by analyzing actual work outputs, then uses this knowledge graph to route questions to the right experts or surface relevant past explanations. It transforms scattered tribal knowledge into an accessible, searchable, and actionable resource.

## Core Concept

### The Problem Space

In modern startups and tech companies:

- Critical knowledge exists but is invisible - trapped in Slack threads, code reviews, and individuals' minds
- New employees spend weeks asking "who should I talk to about X?"
- Senior engineers are constantly interrupted with questions they've already answered
- The same problems get solved multiple times because past solutions aren't discoverable
- When employees leave, their knowledge leaves with them
- There's no way to know who actually has hands-on experience vs. theoretical knowledge

### The Solution

HiMind creates a living map of organizational expertise by observing actual work patterns and interactions. It learns not just what people know, but how they explain it, when they're available, and how reliable their knowledge is in specific domains.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

**Purpose:** Collect signals of expertise from various sources

**Sources:**

- **Slack/Discord/Teams:** Public channel messages, thread responses, reactions
- **GitHub/GitLab:** Pull requests, code reviews, commit messages, issue discussions
- **Documentation platforms:** Confluence/Notion edits and contributions
- **Calendar systems:** Availability and working hours (optional)

**What we track:**

- Who answers questions (and whether the asker indicates satisfaction)
- Who reviews code in which areas
- Who writes documentation on what topics
- Who fixes bugs in which systems
- Response time patterns and availability windows

### 2. Expertise Mapping Engine

**Purpose:** Build and maintain a dynamic graph of who knows what

**Core concepts:**

- **Expertise Score:** Calculated per person, per topic based on:

  - Frequency of successful interventions
  - Quality signals (reactions, thanks, accepted PRs)
  - Recency (recent knowledge weighted higher)
  - Depth (detailed answers score higher than quick responses)

- **Topic Extraction:** Automatically identify expertise areas from:

  - Technologies mentioned (languages, frameworks, tools)
  - Business domains (payments, auth, infrastructure)
  - Problem types (debugging, architecture, performance)

- **Confidence Levels:** Each expertise mapping has a confidence score based on amount and quality of evidence

### 3. Query Processing System

**Purpose:** Understand incoming questions and match them to expertise

**Functionality:**

- Parse natural language questions to extract topics and intent
- Identify whether this is a factual question, debugging help, architecture decision, or opinion request
- Determine urgency level from language patterns
- Check if similar questions have been answered before

### 4. Routing Intelligence

**Purpose:** Decide the best response strategy for each question

**Decision tree:**

1. **Instant Answer:** If highly similar question was answered before → serve previous answer with attribution
2. **Augmented Answer:** If partially answered → combine multiple past responses into comprehensive answer
3. **Expert Routing:** If new question → identify best available expert based on:
   - Expertise score in relevant topics
   - Current availability
   - Recent workload (to prevent overload)
   - Time zone alignment
4. **Escalation Path:** If primary expert unavailable → suggest secondary experts or schedule for later

### 5. Response Generation

**Purpose:** Craft helpful responses that maintain context and attribution

**Response types:**

- **Direct Answer:** "Based on [Expert]'s explanation on [Date]: [Answer]"
- **Composite Answer:** Combining multiple expert inputs with clear attribution
- **Routing Notice:** "I've notified [Expert] who handled this last time. They're typically available at [Time]"
- **Context Package:** For complex questions, provide background context from past discussions

### 6. Learning Loop

**Purpose:** Continuously improve expertise mappings and routing quality

**Feedback signals:**

- Explicit: thumbs up/down on responses
- Implicit: whether routed expert actually responds, response time, follow-up questions
- Quality metrics: question resolution time, number of back-and-forths needed

## User Interactions

### For Question Askers

1. **Natural language input:** Type question in Slack, web interface, or IDE plugin
2. **Instant context:** Receive immediate answer or expert routing
3. **Attribution transparency:** Always know whose knowledge they're accessing
4. **Escalation options:** Can request live expert if automated answer insufficient

### For Experts

1. **Smart notifications:** Only pinged for questions truly in their domain
2. **Context provided:** See what the asker has already tried/been told
3. **Knowledge preservation:** Their answers are captured for future reuse
4. **Load balancing:** System prevents expertise overload

### For Managers/Admins

1. **Expertise visualization:** See knowledge distribution across team
2. **Gap analysis:** Identify areas where team lacks expertise
3. **Knowledge risk:** Spot single points of failure
4. **Onboarding insights:** Track how quickly new hires are gaining expertise

## Privacy and Permissions

### Core Principles

- Only analyze public channels and explicitly shared content
- Never store sensitive data (credentials, PII, financial data)
- Experts can opt-out of specific topics
- All attributions are transparent

### Data Handling

- Questions can be marked as "private" - answered but not stored
- Expertise scores are visible only to admins by default
- Individual contributors can see their own expertise profile
- Right to be forgotten - employees can request data deletion

## Integration Points

### Inbound (Where questions come from)

- Slack slash command: `/ask how do we deploy to staging?`
- Web interface: Standalone search portal
- IDE plugins: Right-click to ask about code
- Browser extension: Ask about documentation
- API: For custom integrations

### Outbound (Where HiMind sends notifications)

- Slack DM to identified expert
- Email for async responses
- Calendar integration for scheduling
- Ticket creation in Jira/Linear for complex issues

## Quality Metrics

### System Health

- **Coverage:** Percentage of topics with identified experts
- **Confidence:** Average confidence score of expertise mappings
- **Freshness:** How recent the knowledge signals are

### User Success

- **Resolution Time:** Time from question to satisfactory answer
- **First Contact Resolution:** Questions answered without escalation
- **Expert Load:** Distribution of questions across experts
- **Knowledge Reuse:** Percentage of questions answered from history

### Business Impact

- **Onboarding Velocity:** Time for new hires to stop asking basic questions
- **Interruption Reduction:** Decrease in random DMs to senior staff
- **Knowledge Retention:** Expertise maintained when employees leave

## Scaling Considerations

### Phase 1 (MVP - Hackathon)

## Competitive Differentiation

**vs. ChatGPT/Claude:**

- Knows YOUR specific architecture, decisions, and trade-offs
- Attributes knowledge to real people
- Understands availability and can route to humans
- Learns from your team's actual work patterns

**vs. Documentation/Wiki:**

- Self-updating from actual work
- Knows who to ask when docs don't exist
- Captures informal knowledge
- Shows what's actually being used vs. what's documented

**vs. Stack Overflow for Teams:**

- Proactive expertise discovery
- Routes questions before they're posted
- Surfaces existing answers automatically
- Maps expertise beyond just Q&A

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (MVP)

- Connect to at least Slack and GitHub
- Build basic expertise graph
- Route questions to experts
- Surface previous answers
- Show expertise visualization

### Should Have

- Quality scoring for answers
- Expert availability checking
- Multiple platform support
- Confidence scores

### Could Have

- Predictive expertise (who's learning what)
- Knowledge gap analysis
- Auto-generated documentation
- Learning path recommendations

## Anti-Goals (What HiMind is NOT)

- **Not a documentation replacement:** Augments but doesn't replace proper docs
- **Not a performance tracker:** Expertise scoring is for routing, not evaluation
- **Not a knowledge gate-keeper:** Facilitates rather than restricts knowledge sharing
- **Not a chat bot:** Human expertise is the core value, AI just routes and surfaces

## Implementation Notes for Developers

This system should be built with modularity in mind - each component (ingestion, mapping, routing) should be independently testable and replaceable. Start with the simplest possible implementation that demonstrates the core value: knowing who knows what and routing questions accordingly.

The wow factor comes not from AI sophistication but from the immediate utility - being able to ask any question and instantly know who can answer it or getting the answer from their past explanations. Every technical decision should optimize for this core experience.

Remember: The goal is to make the company's collective intelligence accessible, not to build another AI assistant. The AI is just the routing layer - the real value is in the human expertise it unlocks.
