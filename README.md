# HiMind 🧠

**AI-powered workplace learning through knowledge discovery**

HiMind discovers and maps organizational knowledge by analyzing actual work - Slack discussions, GitHub contributions, documentation - using embeddings and ML to surface hidden expertise and connect people with the knowledge they need. No Q&A database, just intelligent retrieval of knowledge points and expertise mapping.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# TODO
```

## 💡 The Problem

In modern organizations:

- Knowledge is scattered across platforms without connections
- Expertise is hidden - you don't know who knows what
- Valuable insights are lost in message history
- Knowledge clusters and patterns remain invisible
- No way to discover emerging areas of expertise

## ✨ How It Works

1. **Ingest** content from Slack, GitHub, and other platforms
2. **Extract** knowledge points using NLP and create embeddings
3. **Discover** topic clusters and expertise patterns through ML
4. **Retrieve** relevant knowledge through semantic search
5. **Connect** to experts when knowledge gaps exist

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Semantic Knowledge Search**: Find knowledge using natural language, not keywords
- **Emergent Topic Discovery**: Topics and expertise areas emerge from embedding clusters
- **Expertise Mapping**: Understand who knows what based on actual contributions
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Visualize expertise networks and knowledge distribution
- **No Q&A Database**: Knowledge points are discovered and retrieved, not manually curated

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Lucide React
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Supabase
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings
- **ML/AI**: OpenAI embeddings, vector similarity search
- **NLP**: Topic extraction, entity recognition, quality scoring
- **Integrations**: Slack API, GitHub API
- **Development**: TypeScript, ESLint, Docker

## 📂 Project Structure

TBD

## 🏃‍♂️ Development

```bash
TODO
```

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- Only analyzes public channels
- No sensitive data storage
- All expertise attribution is transparent
- GDPR compliant with right-to-be-forgotten

## 📈 Core Metrics

HiMind tracks:

- **Knowledge Coverage**: How much organizational knowledge is captured
- **Topic Emergence**: New expertise areas discovered through clustering
- **Expertise Distribution**: Who knows what and knowledge concentration
- **Retrieval Effectiveness**: Semantic search precision and recall
- **Knowledge Health**: Gaps, risks, and opportunities in organizational knowledge
