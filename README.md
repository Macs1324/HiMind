# HiMind 🧠

**Instantly find who knows what in your organization**

HiMind automatically maps your team's real expertise by analyzing actual work - code reviews, Slack discussions, documentation contributions - then instantly routes questions to the right expert or surfaces their past explanations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# TODO
